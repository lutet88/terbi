# terbi
terbi is a minimal rhythm game engine in raylib/D.
it is still a WIP.

### install
requires [`dub`](https://github.com/dlang/dub) and some D compiler (I use `LDC2/LDMD2`).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lutet88/terbi
cd terbi
dub run
```

### usage
`SimpleManiaGame` works in its most basic form.

point line 66 in `app.d` towards a `.osu` mania map and it should run.
